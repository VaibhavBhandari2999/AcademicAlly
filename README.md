## Project Summary

AcademicAlly is a comprehensive web-based solution aimed at providing insightful feedback to students to improve their academic performances and aid faculties by giving them valuable inferences and pointers to review their teaching methods. 

It offers a customized user experience for students, enabling them to submit assignments, showing them an interactive dashboard containing their performance and percentile in each subtopic of a subject and allowing them to provide feedback to teachers. The application also reflects the academic standing of the student relative to their peers and provides additional resources to the student on topics requiring improvement.

The solution also helps teachers grade assignments, send feedback to students and showing them an interactive dashboard containing grade details, class averages and in depth statistics  of all students. It also contains an autograder system which grades Multiple Choice Questions instantaneously and provides a plagiarism checker to protect against students copying subjective answers from each other.
